# AI_Tic-Tac-Toe

Tic-Tac-Toe program with three levels, easy, medium and hard, as well as a player-to-player option. The easy level makes moves at random, the medium level moves at random unless there is a winning option, it then either does the move to win or the move to prevent the player from winning. The hard level uses a minmax algorithm to determine the best moves that it should do as well as predicts the best move the player can make.
