# AI_Tic-Tac-Toe

This Tic-Tac-Toe code is a standard version of the popular game with the option to play player vs player, player vs computer, or computer vs computer.
There are three different computer difficulties that operate in different ways.


# Easy Difficulty:
The easy level makes moves at random every move. 

# Medium Difficulty:
The medium level moves at random unless there is a winning option. If so, it either does the move to win or the move to prevent the player from winning. 

# Hard Difficulty:
The hard level uses a minmax algorithm to determine the best moves that it should do as well as predicts the best move the player can make. You can learn more on how the algorithm works by reading the following article:
